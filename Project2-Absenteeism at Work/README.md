## Absenteeism at Work Youtube 
Nowadays, work relationships are becoming more and more trust-oriented, and 
conservative contracts (in which working time is strictly monitored) are being replaced 
with more agile ones in which the employee themselves is responsible for accounting 
working time. This liberty may lead to unregulated absenteeism and may reflect 
poorly on an employee's candidature, even if absent hours can be accounted for with 
genuine reasons. This can significantly undermine healthy working relationships. 
Furthermore, unregulated absenteeism can also have a negative impact on 
work productivity.
In this chapter, we'll analyze absenteeism data from a Brazilian courier company, 
collected between July 2007 and July 2010. 

 we will perform standard data analysis techniques, such as 
 1. estimating  conditional probabilities, Bayes' theorem,
 2. Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, for distribution comparison. You will also implement data
 3.  transformation techniques, such as the Box-Cox and Yeo-Johnson transformations, and apply these techniques to a given dataset.

and We will use new plots such as:
1. violinplot
2. jointplot
3. countplot
